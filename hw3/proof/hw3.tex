%% This section contains some useful macros that will save you time typing.
%%

% Using \displaystyle (or \ds) in a block of math has a number of effects, but most notably, it makes your fractions come out bigger.
\newcommand{\ds}{\displaystyle}

% These lines are for displaying integrals; typing \dx will make the dx at the end of the integral look better.
\newcommand{\is}{\hspace{2pt}}
\newcommand{\dx}{\is dx}

% These commands produce the fancy Z (for the integers) and other letters conveniently.
\newcommand{\Z}{\mathbb{Z}}
\newcommand{\Q}{\mathbb{Q}}
\newcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}}
\newcommand{\C}{\mathbb{C}}
\newcommand{\F}{\mathbb{F}}

\newcommand{\irr}{\operatorname{irr}}

\newcommand{\frob}{\operatorname{Frob}}
\newcommand{\aut}{\operatorname{Aut}}

\begin{document}

We are given $n$ ads and a list of $m$ ad slots on a web page. We know the probability $a_i$ that a user sees the $i$th ad slot, the probability $b_j$ that the user clicks on ad $j$ given that they see the ad, and the revenue $r_j$ that the web owner receives if the user clicks on the ad. Every ad may be displayed at most once. We can assume that $n \geq m$. We need to find an injective map from the set of slots to ads to maximize
\[\sum_{i=1}^m a_ib_{f(i)}r_{f(i)}. \]
\begin{enumerate}
\item A greedy algorithm for this problem is as follows:
\item Its running time is
\item Finally we prove that the algorithm is correct.
\end{enumerate}
