%% This section contains some useful macros that will save you time typing.
%%

% Using \displaystyle (or \ds) in a block of math has a number of effects, but most notably, it makes your fractions come out bigger.
\newcommand{\ds}{\displaystyle}

% These lines are for displaying integrals; typing \dx will make the dx at the end of the integral look better.
\newcommand{\is}{\hspace{2pt}}
\newcommand{\dx}{\is dx}

% These commands produce the fancy Z (for the integers) and other letters conveniently.
\newcommand{\Z}{\mathbb{Z}}
\newcommand{\Q}{\mathbb{Q}}
\newcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}}
\newcommand{\C}{\mathbb{C}}
\newcommand{\F}{\mathbb{F}}

\newcommand{\irr}{\operatorname{irr}}

\newcommand{\frob}{\operatorname{Frob}}
\newcommand{\aut}{\operatorname{Aut}}
